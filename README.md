Audio made with Bfxr (http://www.bfxr.net/), 
Images made with Adobe Photoshop CC (2014) (http://www.adobe.com/hk_en/products/photoshop.html) 

Usage Instructions:

Make sure you got pygame installed on your system (working with python 3), then just compile it and it should open a
window with the resolution of 800 * 600, that will so be adjustable in the main menu (not implemented yet)
